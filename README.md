Subspace Storage Factorio Mod
=============================

**Warning:** this is a work in progress alpha and may not work as advertised.

Allows storing items and fluid into a limitless subspace that is shared across the game world.
With Clusterio you can also share the subspace across a cluster of servers, enabling item and fluid production to be spread across multiple servers.


Build Instructions
------------------

Install Node.js version 10 or later and run `npm install` then run `node build`.
It will output the built mod into the `dist` folder by default.
